Lab03 Bank Account Checking : Console Application

1 Description
A bank charges $10 per month plus the following check fees for a commercial checking account: 
• $.10 for each check if less than 20 checks were written 
• $.08 for each check if 20 through 39 checks were written 
• $.06 for each check if 40 through 59 checks were written 
• $.04 for each check if 60 or more checks were written 

The bank also charges an extra $15 if the account balance falls below $400
(before any check fees are applied). Design a class named BankCharges that stores 
the ending balance of an account and the number of checks written. It should also have 
a method that returns the bank’s service fees for the month. The program that demonstrates 
BankCharges class is given in the ﬁle BankChargesDemo. You are required to read and understand 
the given program in the ﬁle BankChargesDemo and then create the BankCharges class in a separate 
ﬁle named BankCharges, which can work properly with the BankChargesDemo class. You are NOT allowed 
to make any change to the given ﬁle BankChargesDemo.
